## K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

K-N Algo is not a smart algorithm what it usually does is, it takes the data and memorize each bit of it and then when we parse in an image it just finds the most resembling image and then it'll predict or show the label of that image.

Train Complexity O(1)
Predict Complexity O(N)

We want classifiers to be fast at prediction and slow for training but K-nth Neighbor is totally opposite of that.

Dataset to use CIFAR10

L1 / manhattan distance is a comparison method what it does is it creates a difference of two images in pixels values.
